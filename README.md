# FINAL_PYTHON
This is my python final project 


Hello!!

This program is made as my python final project of the programming subject.
For 
Este es un programa hecho como proyecto final de la asignatura programación para bioinformática de cuarto de biotecnología.

To run the program, just run TOTAL.py having the other files in the same folder with the prosite.dat file and the query.fasta (file with all the querys). The genbanks files must be in another folder where there are only files of this type.

If you need help using the program just put in the termnal ./TOTAL.py and it will show the help function for you.

_Things you have to know before running this program:
_- The file with all the querys must be in the same folder as the script files.
_- The prosite.dat file must be in the same folder as the script files.
_- The folder with all the genbank files must be in the same folder as the script files.
_- After running the program all the files created by it will be moved to the Results folder and the files will be named as the corresponding querys

Have fun using this program, I hope it is useful.
